# RATIONALE #
* A custom app to be available in the Windows, MacOSX  and Linux realm with a focus on simplicity and minimalism
* Must comply with 2 premises: closed architecture across operating systems (_search_ and _show_ the results) and strict offline mode, so any query done do not need to connect to any remote server
* This repo is a living document that will grow and adapt over time
* The principles of this project were driven by [The Zen of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python)
